0.200  2013-05-24

 - (Documentation) Document relationship with Type::Tiny.
 - (Packaging) Skip tests involving given/when, smart match, and lexical $_
   in Perl >= 5.17.
 - (Update) Deprecate Scalar::Does::MooseTypes.
 - (Update) Use Exporter::TypeTiny instead of Sub::Exporter.
 - (Update) Use Type::Tiny and Types::Standard to perform type checking for
   built-in Scalar::Does roles, and also Scalar::Does::MooseTypes roles.

0.102  2013-03-10

 - (Bugfix) Scalar::Util version in lib/Scalar/Does.pm and
   meta/makefile.pret should match.

0.101  2013-03-08

 - (Documentation) Show how IO::Detect's constants can be used with
   Scalar::Does's does() function.
 - IO::Detect now performs the same namespace::clean trickery as
   Scalar::Does to fake lexical subs.
 - Improve test suite cleanliness; use Test::Requires, etc.
 - does($class, $overloaded_operation) no longer returns true.
   does($instance, $overloaded_operation) still works of course!
 - use lexical::underscore instead of directly mucking around with
   PadWalker.

0.100  2013-03-07

 - (Packaging) Merge IO-Detect distribution into Scalar-Does.
 - (Packaging) The IO-Detect-Changes.txt file lists changes to the
   IO-Detect distribution prior to merge.
 - (Update) New test case for IO::Detect/Path::Tiny interaction.

   09warnings.t.

0.010  2012-12-05

 - (Documentation) Add documentation for test suite.
 - (Update) Perl 5.17 has changed the behaviour of UNIVERSAL::can($pkg,
   'can'), so that it is no longer useful for detecting whether a package
   is loaded. Changed Scalar::Does::MooseLike to avoid this idiom.

0.009  2012-11-05  # Gunpowder, treason and plot

0.008  2012-10-27

 - (Documentation Removal) Remove references to Object-DOES in
   documentation.
 - (Documentation) Revise documentation about Role::Tiny/Moo::Role's lack

   now check $_.
